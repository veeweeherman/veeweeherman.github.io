title: Up and Atom!
---

For a while now, I've been thinking about switching text editors (doesn't this sound like an info-mercial about switching health insurance or upgrading to a Ferrari? Don't worry, it's not).

[Atom](atom.io) is an open-source text editor created by GitHub. Not only does it really facilitate the open-source community, it also allows fellow engineers to truly personalize the tools they use to make them more efficient. Engineers from around the world can create their own packages (like a [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) or [CSS hexadecimal color finder](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker
)) and contribute to the Atom package library so others can use it as well.

I was content with Sublime Text, but I felt like it was time to find something I *loved*. I was Atom-curious for quite a while, and at first it didn't do much for me. But then when I realized how customizable it was, it was heaps more exciting!

Here's how excited I was: I'm going to take a completely stereotypically feminine approach to this...

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
var downloadAtomEditor = like buying that perfect dress;
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
var customizeWithAtomPackages = like shopping for accessories to accompany that dress to create the perfect outfit... Except all the accessories are FREE!;
{% endhighlight %}

Imagine buying the perfect dress but then going around for all the matching accessories and not paying a cent for any of them. That's why I'm hooked to Atom at the moment :)

There are a bunch of packages I installed, but I'll highlight two:

1. [JSHint](https://atom.io/packages/jshint) yes, I love Javasript, and this package lets me run code with a simple ```cmd+i```
2. [markdown-preview](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview) if you code and blog in your text editor with Markdown files (filename.md), this lets you preview the .md file with ```shift+ctrl+m```

One funky thing that happened with markdown-preview though (and I wish I had found a blog on it before having to hunt it down!) because I'd already downloaded the [Emmet](https://discuss.atom.io/t/keyboard-shortcut-overriding-emmet-and-markdown-preview/14113) package, the markdown-preview command (```shift+strl+m```) conflicted with Emmet's command also. So be weary of that. You can go into the [keymaps](https://atom.io/docs/latest/behind-atom-keymaps-in-depth) file and customize your keyboard commands for Atom.

If I've convinced you to switch to Atom, and I hope I have, here's how to get started!
