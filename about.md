<p class="heavy-title">I’m a software engineer at 99designs in Oakland, CA. Our stack is Rails, PHP, and some React with Flux. I love my job because everyday I feel like I'm simultaneously drowning swimming. When I’m not coding, you can find me bicycling up a steep mountain, sipping coffee, or watching deep sea documentaries.</p>
