I’m a full stack software engineer with a strong background in Javascript. I’ve built apps using React, Node, PostgreSQL and deployed a number of said apps on Heroku. I enjoy teaming up with other creative and fun engineers and experimenting with the possibilities. I also get a thrill from the challenge of tackling recursive algorithms and implementing data structures. When I’m not coding, you can find me bicycling up a steep mountain, sipping coffee, or watching deep sea documentaries.
