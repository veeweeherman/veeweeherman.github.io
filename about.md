I love nerding out on algorithms and data structures because they're tough, fun and rewarding all at the same time.

### More Information
When I'm not coding, I'm cycling up steep mountains, traveling the world, rock climbing, or watching documentaries on sea life.

I have an insatiable thirst for nerd-knowledge, a love for cat-puns and a set of dancing shoes ready.
